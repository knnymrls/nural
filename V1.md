# Nexus: Internal Knowledge Assistant Overview

Nexus is an intelligent assistant designed to help users quickly find the most relevant employees for any task or question. It behaves like ChatGPT, but uses your internal employee data to answer questions with context, memory, and conversational clarity.

---

## 🧠 What Nexus Does
Nexus allows users to ask natural-language questions like:

> “Who’s best for leading an AI infrastructure project?”  
> “What projects has Sarah done?”  
> “Compare and contrast the strengths of Sarah and Alice to see who'd be best. Give it in short bullet points”

It responds with answers that sound like a knowledgeable coworker — direct, helpful, and context-aware.

## 🧩 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Load and Format Employee Profiles
- All employee data (e.g., name, title, skills, projects) is loaded and formatted into readable summaries.
- Each summary is converted into an AI-friendly format using **embeddings** — numeric representations of meaning.

### 2. Semantic Matching
When a user asks a question, the system:
- Converts their question into an embedding.
- Compares it to all employee embeddings using **cosine similarity**.
- Selects the top 3 most relevant employee profiles based on meaning, not just keywords.

### 3. Chat Memory and GPT-4
Nexus uses **persistent memory** like ChatGPT:
- Every question and answer is stored in a `chat_history`.
- Relevant employee profiles are passed alongside the question.
- GPT-4 sees the full conversation + matching employee data and generates a smart, natural answer.

### 4. Follow-Up Support
Because Nexus remembers the conversation, users can ask follow-up questions like:
> “What else has she worked on?”  
> “Can you give me more detail on that project?”  

And GPT will respond with continuity — without needing the user to repeat themselves.

## 🤖 What Makes Nexus Smart

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Embeddings** | Capture the meaning of employee bios and user questions |
| **Vector Search** | Finds the most relevant people by comparing meanings |
| **Chat Memory** | Keeps the conversation flowing with context |
| **GPT-4** | Generates human-like, accurate answers based on the input |

## ✅ Why This Is Powerful

- Users don’t need to know job titles or filters — they just ask questions.
- It adapts to how people speak, not how data is stored.
- It scales naturally as you add more employees or update profiles.
- It’s useful for team leads, recruiters, and managers trying to connect skills to needs.

## 🛠 Example Use Case

> **Q:** Who’s best for backend development?  
> **A:** Tom Rivera is your best fit. He built scalable APIs and led a serverless data pipeline project that cut infra costs by 30%.

> **Q:** What else has he worked on?  
> **A:** He also built the data API used across three client apps and mentors junior engineers weekly.

## 🧪 Technical Summary

- Built using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` for vector search.
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for conversation and memory.
- Stores profile embeddings for fast lookup (cached with NumPy).
- Maintains an in-memory chat history for fluid multi-turn dialogue.
